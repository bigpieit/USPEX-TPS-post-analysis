The percentage of atoms with different CN are calculated and ploted during the phase transition

crnum_all.crn is required for this folder before performing calculation.

******************
1. Execute the start.sh 
   'crn.png' will be plotted to describe the change in the percentage of atoms with different coordinates.
   'crn.txt' will be save to report for average percentage for atoms with  different coordinates in the region, where 12-coordinated atoms has the lowest percentage.
 
******************
The movie can be made by using VMD. Atoms with different CN are in different colors.
1. Execute VMD. In your VMD, execute the
   play make-x.tcl : produce movie viewed along x axis
   play make-y.tcl : produce movie viewed along y axis
   play make-z.tcl : produce movie viewed along z axis
By default, atoms with different CN are in the following colors:
CN = 9 white
CN = 10 purple
CN = 11 red
CN = 12 blue
CN = 13 green
CN = 14 yellow
