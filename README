This is the folder used to calculate the CN, msd, enthalpy and structure similarity information during phase transition.

1. crnum folder has the following functions:
   a. calcualte and plot the percentage of atoms with different CN.
   b. make movie for phase transition, in which atom with different CN is in different colors.
   c. calculate msd from the middle of the trajectory or from the double-ends of the trajectory.

2. thermo foler has the following functions:
   a. plot the enthalpy and temperature information during phase transition.
   b. plot the structure similarity during phase transition and characterize the transition region.

README is attached in each folder and its sub-folders to instruct how to perform calculation.
